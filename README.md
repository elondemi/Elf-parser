The Executable and Linkable Formatis a file format of executable files, libraries, object files in UNIX-like systems. 
1. Executable File: A file which can be run by the Operating System. It is generated by linking one or more object files. The main difference between other ELF files and an Executable file is that this type of file has an entry-point.
2. Shared Object file: You might have heard of program using libraries. Each of these libraries are present in the form of shared object files. 
3. Object file: Direct machine code equivalent of a C source file. It has just a little metadata(which is part of ELF) to keep the code organized.

The ELF is a very interesting and magical format. It is a combination of tightly knit data structures. It has a lot of interesting structures involved, each doing a particular function.
